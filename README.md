# connect4

Simple connect 4 game server in Go with htmx.

Built as a learning exercise in scaling a Go application from single client to multiple concurrent users.

Goals:

- Learn Go testing and implement some testing.
- 1v1 on different clients (distinguish P1 and P2).
- ~~Multiple concurrent games.~~
- ~~Allow creation of games and sharing with link.~~
- ~~Deleting inactive games (There is a memory leak lol)~~
- Simulation testing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Set up tailwind bundling
- Make it pretty
